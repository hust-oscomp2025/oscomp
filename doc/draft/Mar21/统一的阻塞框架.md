Based on your code, I can see you're currently using a separately allocated `ktrapframe` in PCB to store context during blocking and resuming. Modern kernels often use a more efficient stack-based context switching approach. Here's a design for improving this:

## Stack-Based Context Switching Design

### Key Concept
Instead of allocating a separate `ktrapframe` structure, store context directly on the kernel stack of the blocked process.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Modify Process Structure**:
   ```c
   struct task_struct {
     // Existing fields
     uint64 kstack;          // Kernel stack pointer
     uint64 context_sp;      // Saved stack pointer during context switch
     // Other fields
   }
   ```

2. **Context Switch Mechanism**:
   ```c
   void switch_context(struct task_struct *prev, struct task_struct *next) {
     // Save current context to prev's kernel stack and update context_sp
     if (prev) {
       asm volatile(
         "sd ra, 0(sp)\n"
         "sd sp, 8(sp)\n"
         // Save other callee-saved registers (s0-s11)
         "sd s0, 16(sp)\n"
         // ...
         "sd s11, 144(sp)\n"
         "addi %0, sp, 0"
         : "=r" (prev->context_sp)
         :
         : "memory"
       );
     }
     
     // Switch to next task's kernel stack
     if (next->context_sp) {
       // Restore from saved context
       asm volatile(
         "mv sp, %0\n"
         "ld ra, 0(sp)\n"
         // Restore other callee-saved registers
         "ld s0, 16(sp)\n"
         // ...
         "ld s11, 144(sp)\n"
         "ld sp, 8(sp)"
         :
         : "r" (next->context_sp)
         : "memory"
       );
     } else {
       // First-time scheduling (initialize to kernel entry point)
       // Set up stack for next process
       sp = next->kstack + KSTACK_SIZE - 16;
       ((uint64*)sp)[0] = (uint64)kernel_entry_point;
       next->context_sp = sp;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Blocking Implementation**:
   ```c
   void block_current_task(enum task_state state) {
     CURRENT->state = state;
     schedule_next();  // This will save context and switch to another task
   }

   void schedule_next() {
     struct task_struct *prev = CURRENT;
     struct task_struct *next = pick_next_task();
     
     if (prev != next) {
       CURRENT = next;
       switch_context(prev, next);
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Wakeup Implementation**:
   ```c
   void wakeup_task(struct task_struct *task) {
     task->state = TASK_RUNNING;
     insert_to_ready_queue(task);
   }
   ```

### Advantages

1. **Memory Efficiency**: No need to allocate separate `ktrapframe` structures
2. **Performance**: Faster context switching with fewer memory operations
3. **Simplicity**: Context is managed naturally with the flow of function calls
4. **Cache Friendliness**: Better locality of reference for the process context

### Integration with Interrupt Handling

For integrating with your existing trap handling code:

1. Modify your trap handling to use the same context saving mechanism
2. Use a consistent approach for saving/restoring registers between normal context switches and trap handling
3. Keep the user-mode trapframe as is, since it serves a different purpose

This design would require adjusting your scheduler code, but would result in a more efficient and modern context switching implementation.
