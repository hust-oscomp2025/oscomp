This implementation provides the core logic for POSIX advisory file locking. It handles the three main locking commands:

1. `F_GETLK` - Test if a lock can be acquired
2. `F_SETLK` - Try to acquire a lock (non-blocking)
3. `F_SETLKW` - Try to acquire a lock (blocking)

The implementation includes pseudo-code for dependent functions like `find_conflicting_lock`, `wait_for_lock_release`, and `add_lock_to_file` which would need to be implemented separately. The actual lock storage would typically be maintained in a lock list associated with each file or inode.

For a complete implementation, you would need to:

1. Define a `struct file_lock` structure
2. Implement lock list management functions
3. Implement conflict detection algorithms
4. Create proper waiting and notification mechanisms for blocking locks

This provides the core framework that can be expanded to a full implementation.
